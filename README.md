# Gratitude Diary

This application was inspired by advice from my mom. When I wasn't feeling my best, she told me to write down all of the things for which I am grateful--things about my day, my friends, my family, myself, whatever. This always managed my to improve my attitude. Recognizing all of the good things about your situation can put the not-so-good things in perspective.

That's the thinking behind this application. A user can view a homepage, introduction, create an account or login, and then log all of his/her entries for that moment. This application intends to help people help themselves, because we're all better off in a happier world.

This is my first stab at a React Native mobile application after working with React for web applications.
